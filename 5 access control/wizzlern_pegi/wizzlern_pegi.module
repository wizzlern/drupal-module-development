/**
 * Implements hook_ENTITY_TYPE_access().
 *
 * Drupal has two mechanism for access control. One at database level and
 * one using fully loaded entities. The first one (using hook_node_grants()
 * and hook_node_access_records()) is preferred for performance. The second
 * (using hook_ENTITY_TYPE_access()) uses the fully loaded entity and is
 * preferred for edit and delete operations. It allows access check on dynamic
 * data, but performs less for 'view' operations because the entity has to be
 * loaded before access can be checked.
 *
 * @param \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityInterface $entity
 *   The entity to check access to.
 * @param string $operation
 *   The operation that is to be performed on $entity.
 * @param \Drupal\Core\Session\AccountInterface $account
 *    The account trying to access the entity.
 * @param string $langcode
 *    The code of the language $entity is accessed in.
 * @return bool|null
 *   A boolean to explicitly allow or deny access, or NULL to neither allow nor
 *   deny access.
 *
 * @see hook_ENTITY_TYPE_access()

  // 3. Get the users's age.
  // 4. Compare the two and allow/deny access as appropriate.

  //    the user has no age set?
